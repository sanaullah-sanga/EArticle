The NewspaperImran KhanYaqoob Khan BangashAbbas NasirAsad Rahim KhanShahzad SharjeelIrfan Husain,Broadcasting rights holder takes PCB to court over PSL money row,2020-07-05,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is quite determined to complete the Pakistan Super League (PSL) season five by holding the remaining semifinals and the final later this year to decide the title winner of the league. It has been learnt that the PCB is very keen to find a suitable window for holding the remaining games around November, either in Pakistan or in the UAE, but that, of course, depends largely on the Covid-19 situation at that juncture.However, according to ESPNCricinfo, the financial impact of the unfinished fifth season of the PSL is creating problems for the PCB which is apparently at the loggerheads now with the league’s broadcast-rights holder and have come to legal blows over the money due for the season.The ESPNCricinfo reports that the fifth edition — the first held in its entirety in Pakistan — had to be curtailed just before the knockout stages due to the fast-spreading pandemic threat. That has now led to Blitz Advertising and Techfront — who signed up for the broadcast rights in 2018 in a US$36 million deal — holding back a payout to the board for this season.According to the PCB, the contract states that payment is conditional to the scheduled day of the last match and once that payment did not come through this season, the PCB cashed an insurance guarantee from the broadcaster (held as security for the deal) of PKR 1 billion. It is that act that Blitz has taken a stay order out against in the civil courts in Lahore.“Our dispute with the PCB is on issue of completion of PSL 2020 Tournament,” a Blitz official told ESPNcricinfo. “PCB has announced/declared since March 17th that four matches including semi-finals and final shall be held later in year 2020 and is postponed until then. According to our agreements with PCB, it is stated clearly — we are to pay the rights fees only after the last match of the PSL 2020 tournament is held and declared. Since last match of the PSL 2020 has not been held and/or declared by PCB, therefore the Rights Fee is not due and payable under the agreements.The ESPNCricinfo report says that, “Blitz was constrained to seek legal remedy through courts, refraining encashment of guarantee since the payment was not due until the last Match of PSL 2020 was declared by PCB. Blitz, in the last five years of its relationship with PCB has honored all its obligations in accordance with the agreements. However in this instance, Blitz in view of PCB’s unjustified demand had no other option but to approach courts for relief.”Published in Dawn, July 5th, 2020"
Yaqoob Khan BangashAbbas NasirAsad Rahim KhanShahzad SharjeelIrfan Husain,Indian police busts fake SL T20 event,2020-07-05,"NEW DELHI: Indian police are investigating an alleged betting scandal in which a sham cricket tournament was held in an Indian village and passed off as a Twenty20 contest played in Sri Lanka.Players portrayed as Sri Lankan cricketers played two matches on Monday that were broadcast with live commentary on YouTube, media reports said, along with ball-by-ball coverage on top Indian sports websites.The organisers hung Sri Lankan advertisements at the ground for added authenticity and put up tents to block the view from outside the remote rural venue, set in farmland next to a busy highway.Police said they raided the venue in northern India’s Sawara village —thousands of kilometres (miles) from Sri Lanka — after receiving a tip-off that the matches were being used for betting.They added that two people were arrested on charges of fraud and gambling — which is mostly illegal in India. The organisers and players are being sought.“They pretended to be Sri Lankan teams, playing in Sri Lanka with the motive of online betting,” Mohali police chief Kuldeep Singh Chahal said.Leading Indian sports websites had announced that the ‘Uva T20 league’ was organised by the Uva cricket association at a stadium in Sri Lankan town of Badulla.They said former Sri Lankan internationals would take part and that it would include four teams and 14 games between July 29 and July 5.But the Uva T20 league does not exist and Sri Lanka Cricket denied hosting it, adding no tournament of that name was organised in the island nation.One of the players advertised as playing in the event, ex-Sri Lanka international Farveez Maharoof, tweeted that the tournament was ‘fake’.The owners of the village venue in India, Strokers Cricket Association, said the organisers told them they were playing a domestic tournament over nearly about days, but without spectators because of the coronavirus.It was unclear how many people watched the event online or how much money was put on the matches.Published in Dawn, July 5th, 2020"
Yaqoob Khan BangashAbbas NasirAsad Rahim KhanShahzad SharjeelIrfan Husain,Legendary Lin Dan announces retirement,2020-07-05,"SHANGHAI: China’s two-time Olympic champion Lin Dan, arguably the greatest badminton player of all time, announced his retirement on Saturday aged 36.It means that Lin, who won gold at the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Games, will not compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which have been pushed back to the next summer because of coronavirus.The end of Lin’s glorious career comes just over a year after the retirement of his great rival and friend, the Malaysian star Lee Chong Wei.The duo reigned over badminton for more than a decade and have only relinquished that hold in recent years as their powers waned.Lin, who had something of a “bad boy” reputation during his younger days and has several tattoos — unusual for Chinese athletes — ends with 666 singles wins and a glut of medals.“My family, coaches, team-mates and fans have accompanied me through many peaks and difficult troughs,” he said in a post on China’s Twitter-like Weibo that quickly went viral.“Every forceful jump was a desire for victory.“I have dedicated everything to this sport I love.”Lee called his nemesis Lin “my greatest opponent”.“Please believe that the laughter, tears and all the promises are unforgettable diary entries,” the 37-year-old Lee wrote on Weibo. “Proud of you,” he added.As well as the Olympic golds, Lin was also a five-time world champion and long-time world number one. He earned the nickname “Super Dan” at the peak of his career.However, the left-hander’s career has tailed off in recent years as age and injuries took their toll.Just last year he rebuffed claims that he was about to retire following a series of first-round exits at tournaments.Lin always said he was determined to reach the Tokyo Olympics, but his ranking of 19 in the world and the postponement of the Games made that dream unlikely.At Rio 2016 Lin lost in the semi-finals to Lee in what was a rare victory for the Malaysian on the biggest stage of all.Lin said on Saturday his body would not allow him to plough on in the unlikely pursuit of a third Games gold.“‘Persevere’, I said to myself in every moment of suffering, so that my sporting career could be prolonged,” he wrote on Weibo.“Rather than simply pursuing rankings as I did when I was younger, in these years, I have been wanting to challenge the physical limits of an ‘old’ athlete and practise the sporting spirit that I will never give up.“[But] my physical abilities and pain no longer allow me to fight alongside my team-mates.”Published in Dawn, July 5th, 2020"
Yaqoob Khan BangashAbbas NasirAsad Rahim KhanShahzad SharjeelIrfan Husain,"United rout Bournemouth, Vardy reaches century",2020-07-05,"LONDON: Manchester United powered into fourth place in the Premier League with a 5-2 rout of struggling Bournemouth, while Leicester City got back on track in a 3-0 win against Crystal Palace on Saturday.Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side boosted their bid to qualify for next season’s Champions League thanks to a swaggering display at Old Trafford.Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Bruno Fernandes and Mason Greenwood, who netted twice, were all on the scoresheet to lift United provisionally one point above fifth-placed Chelsea.Third-placed Leicester are three points above United as the race reach Europe’s elite club competition hots up.United have won their last four games in all competitions, scoring 13 goals in the process.They were rocked in the 16th minute when Junior Stanislas gave Bournemouth a shock lead.Stanislas’ initial effort was blocked but he cleverly nutmegged Harry Maguire on the touchline and shot past David De Gea at his near post.United hit back 13 minutes later when Greenwood finished off a flowing break for his 14th goal this term.Fernandes picked out the 18-year-old on the edge of the area and his strike raced past Bournemouth keeper Aaron Ramsdale.United doubled their lead in the 35th minute after Adam Smith was penalised for handball in the area.Rashford converted the spot-kick for his 20th club goal of the season.Martial joined the party in first half stoppage-time.Cutting in from the left, the French striker beat Ramsdale with a superb curling effort from the edge of the area.Martial and Rashford both now have 20 goals in all competitions this season -- the first time a United pair have managed that since Dimitar Berbatov and Javier Hernandez in the 2010-11 campaign.Eric Bailly gave Bournemouth brief hope when he conceded a penalty just four minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute.The United defender’s handball was ruled by VAR to be just inside the area and Josh King scored the spot-kick.Solskjaer’s men were unfazed and Greenwood restored their two-goal cushion five minutes later as he shot into the top corner after eluded Diego Rico.Fernandes capped another influential display when the Portugal playmaker bent a powerful free-kick beyond Ramsdale in the 59th minute.At the King Power Stadium, Leicester went ahead five minutes into the second half thanks to a mistake from Palace keeper Vicente Guaita.Marc Albrighton and Ayoze Perez combined to pick out Youri Tielemans and when the Belgian swung a cross into the six-yard box, Kelechi Iheanacho poked home after Guaita failed to collect.Jamie Vardy bagged his 100th Premier League goal in the 77th minute, the striker becoming the 29th player to reach the milestone as he tapped in Harvey Barnes’ pass.Vardy struck again in the 90th minute as Leicester won for the first time in five games.Norwich City manager Daniel Farke conceded his side are heading for relegation after Leandro Trossard fired Brighton & Hove Albion to a 1-0 win at Carrow Road.Trossard netted in the first half to move Brighton nine points clear of the relegation zone before the bulk of the weekend’s matches.Brighton’s second win in four games since the restart puts them in position beat the drop, but the picture is much bleaker for Norwich.With five matches left, Norwich are seven points from safety after losing all five games following the coronavirus hiatus.Farke knows Norwich’s chances of avoiding an immediate return to the Championship are almost over, especially with games against Chelsea and Manchester City still to come.“It was more or less our last chance to get back in the mix and we are disappointed,” he said. “After a few losses, we don’t have the right to make any fighting messages or to make any unrealistic claims.”Published in Dawn, July 5th, 2020"

Yaqoob Khan BangashAbbas NasirAsad Rahim KhanShahzad SharjeelIrfan Husain,English counties allowed two overseas players per team from 2021,2020-07-05,"LONDON: England’s 18 first-class counties will be allowed to field two overseas players per side in domestic four-day and 50-over matches from 2021, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced on Friday.Teams are currently allowed to field only one overseas player, though foreign-born cricketers with British passports and those on Kolpak deals are classed as ‘home’ registrations.But a consequence of Brexit is that Kolpak arrangements — which allow cricketers whose countries have trade deals with the European Union to be treated as local employees — will no longer apply to county cricket after the end of the postponed 2020 season.Friday’s announcement, however, could see many of the affected players, as well as all those whose contracts for the season were terminated because of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, in county action next year.As is currently the case, two overseas players per side will continue to remain the rule in Twenty20 Blast matches. The changes to four-day and 50-over cricket were recommended by the performance cricket committee, whose chairman is Andrew Strauss.“There is an important balance to be struck to ensure the need for good foreign players in county cricket and providing opportunity for nine England-qualified players in each county team,” said Strauss in an ECB statement. “There are clearly long-established benefits for our domestic players to compete against and learn from the best players from across the world in addition to providing high-quality domestic cricket for county members and fans to enjoy.”But Michael Vaughan, another ex-England captain, recently called for a temporary halt on overseas deals in a bid to save counties’ money as they deal with the financial fall-out from Covid-19.The changes will see English cricket reverting to a system that operated during the 1970s and 1980s when counties routinely could fielded two overseas players each.That era saw Test team-mates become opponents, with Sir Vivian Richards and Joel Garner starring for Somerset while West Indies colleagues Gordon Greenidge and Malcolm Marshall played for Hampshire and Gloucestershire boasted of Zaheer Abbas and his fellow Pakistani batsman Sadiq Mohammad, whose older sibling Mushtaq and Sarfraz Nawaz represented Nothamptonshire.But with the growth in international matches and the rise of lucrative franchise competitions such as the Indian Premier League, it has become increasingly difficult for counties to retain top overseas players for a full season.Published in Dawn, July 5th, 2020"
The Newspaper'S Staff ReporterAmir IndianGopal PatelPoint Of ViewKamal ChowkidarVishwanath NagarajIndia IndiaIqbal Hussain PhdRaja RamanA Shah,Masood asks UK to avoid diplomatic escapism on Kashmir,2020-07-05,"ISLAMABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir President Sardar Masood Khan has urged the British government to avoid diplomatic escapism and refrain from terming the Kashmir dispute a bilateral issue.Speaking at a webinar titled “Twin Lockdown in Kashmir and Global Response” organised by the Tehreek-i-Kashmir-UK on Saturday, he asked parliamentarians and civil society of Britain to have a dialogue with 10 Downing Street, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Dominic Raab and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office over the deteriorating situation in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Read: Occupied Kashmir sees 229 killings in first half of 2020: reportAcademics and leading members of parliament belonging to the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrats, and Scottish National parties took part in the webinar.The AJK president said concrete steps should be taken to help stop the egregious human rights violations, killings, torture, rapes and incarcerations taking place under the twin lockdown, firstly in the shape of a siege imposed in August last year and now a Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, which have made the lives of Kashmiris a living hell.British MPs attend webinar on ‘Twin Lockdown in Kashmir and Global Response’According to a statement, Labour MP Liam Byrne said the United Kingdom had to drop the pretence that this disputed issue must be resolved bilaterally. There should be impartial third-party mediation for the resolution of the issue in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir. He said there was a risk of war if the situation escalated amongst the two neighbours.Mr Byrne condemned the growing sectarian polarisation in India and termed it degradation of its secular character.MP Jim McMahon (Labour) said that almost one year had passed since the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had released its second report on Kashmir on July 8 last year but since then no progress had taken place and instead the situation had deteriorated even more.MP Nadia Whittome (Labour) demanded withdrawal of troops and an end to human rights violations in Occupied Kashmir. She said that Articles 35-A and 370 should be immediately restored.MP Stella Creasy (Labour) vowed to raise the issue of Kashmir with parliamentarians from all parties.MP James Daly, Chairman of Conservative Friends of Kashmir and Vice-Chair of All-Party Parliamentary Group in Kashmir, committed to standing for the inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people.The AJK president in his address said that the situation in Occupied Kashmir was fast deteriorating and there was a humanitarian and human rights crisis there. Referring to the recent Sopore shooting incident where 65-year-old Bashir Ahmed Khan was martyred, and images of his three-year-old grandson wailing atop his lifeless body went viral, he said the episode was a harrowing reminder of the atrocities perpetrated by ruthless Indian troops.“In April this year, they [India] went a step further and introduced the New Domicile Rules. Under these rules, India has done away with the Kashmiris’ exclusive right to livelihood, acquisition of property, employment and educational scholarships.”Mr Khan likened India’s actions taken to reoccupy the territory and further bifurcating it to an act of imperialism and settler colonialism.Speaking about the religious divide and discrimination against Muslims all over India and Occupied Kashmir that has been witnessed under the BJP-RSS regime, the president said that these actions were akin to the steps taken by Hitler’s Nazi party in the last century.He said that currently the whole territory of Occupied Kashmir was under an occupational lockdown. Hundreds of Kashmiris have been killed over the past 11 months and thousands of young Kashmiris are in jails. The head of the Jammu and Kashmir police has acknowledged that 22 “militants have been killed in the past two months. India is carrying out genocide, ethnic cleansing and committing war crimes in Occupied Kashmir”, he said.Masood Khan said that anodyne statements made by the UN secretary general did not affect India. “India continues its rampage in Occupied Kashmir and it is imperative for the UN Security Council to take cognisance of the situation in Kashmir as it is an active item on their calendar.”The president thanked the chair of the session, Fahim Kiani, for organising seminal conference. He also expressed gratitude to Ms Uzma Rasool, moderator of the session, who had tabled a Kashmir resolution at the Labour Party Convention.Shadow Secretary of State for Transport Jim McMahon OBE MP, former member of European Parliament Phil Bennion, Brenden O’Hara MP, Alex Norris MP, Christian Wakeford MP, Stella Creasy MP, Rachel Maskell MP, Danish Writer Jane Teller, Senior Kashmiri Hurriyat Leader and Chairman Jammu Kashmir Salvation Movement Altaf Ahmed Bhat and Chairman of the Kashmir Institute of International Relations Altaf Ahmed Wani also attended the webinar.Published in Dawn, July 5th, 2020"
