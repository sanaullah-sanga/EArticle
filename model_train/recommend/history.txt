Hammad Gilani,Food security and sustainability during the pandemic,2020-05-30,Politics,virus provides opportunity But will we Take itAmid rising deaths from the coronavirus worldwide the World Food Programme WFP has warned that the world could face a “global hunger pandemic” as the number of people suffering from malnutrition could double this year According to its report at the end of 2019 approximately 130 million people globally were facing “severe hunger” Currently most countries around the world are facing lockdown and the number has risen to 265 million Even before the coronavirus pandemic more than two billion people were malnourished infant mortality rate was said to be unacceptably high Against this background there was emphasis on global research efforts for controlling the escalating level food insecurityAfter World War II 2020 could be considered the worst for human crisis say international think tanks In addition to wartorn ecologically and economically disadvantaged countries there are many other poor and semimediocre countries that will be immensely affected by the spread of the coronavirus problem will be exacerbated by various economic pressures In such countries the graph of remittances will also fall charity Oxfam has warned that the economic effects of the coronavirus could add up to half a billion people worldwide slipping into poverty Citing research from the Australian National University and King’s College London Oxfam said it would be the first time in 30 years that global poverty has increased According to the report due to the unwanted conditions created by the novel virus the economic crisis will be more severe than the medical crisis and global poverty will increase significantly United Nations’ sustainable development goals include the eradication of hunger To feed 10 billion persons in 2050 we need to get the tradeoffs right between sustainability food security and food safety and make better use of food already producedEven under normal circumstances Pakistan has failed to fight inflation and poverty biggest challenge is the economic situation of the average Pakistani which does not allow him to be limited to the extent that saves him from the virusThe hierarchy of strategies for reducing food losses and waste are in descending order source reduction reusing or reprocessing surplus foods recycle food as feed for animals recover the energy as biofuels nutrients as compost or raw materials for industry while as last resorts one may consider recovering the energy by incineration or dumping it as garbage in landfills Food safety and security are two complementing elements of our sustainable future Hence we need novel solutions for our future food security and sustainability without compromising food safety to achieve the United Nations sustainable development goals SDG including the eradication of hunger and poverty clean water sustainable land use responsible production and consumption mitigating climate change and sustainable life on land and water coronavirus has brought many bitter truths together in countries like Pakistan There are less equipped hospitals fewer resources less capacity impractical policy approach and lack of awareness in a country In the presence of the aforementioned huge challenges if we deal with this epidemic successfully it will not be considered less than a miracle At the international level experts believe that the coronavirus will change the world By several reports of international organizations it is observed that there exists a risk of intense waves of hunger and poverty ranging from highly developed countries to underdeveloped countries Economic mismanagement is at the root of all the world’s problems From psychological problems to the decline of social values the root of the problem is economic misery About 60 million people in Pakistan are living below the poverty line poor are growing the resources are shrinking From the coronavirus those bitter realities have come to the fore again which are somehow covered up problem is everyone has to stay home if they want to avoid the virus Those whose pockets are full are filling their homes with groceries People who are free from stomach worries are showing their new hobbies on social media and encouraging people to stay at home Some people share a list of books and movies on social media and say that they stay away from the virus at home Read the best books in the world and watch super hit moviesA few realistsare adding romantic colours to such suggestions They say to give the family time Avoid doing things that you have never been able to do with your family because of your busy schedule and take advantage of the opportunity to do so However the poorest section of Pakistan is deprived of the luxury of such thinking Along with corona poverty is spreading in front of them Everything will stop voices are also holding their breath If they don’t go to work will the family eat And if they go out they and their families may be at risk of contracting the virus What advice do you give to these poor people the middle class of Pakistan will try to follow somehow awareness campaign for hygiene and precautionary measures that is going on at the moment but the millions of people who barely eat two meals a day who live in dirty houses and rubbish bins how will they take care of all this hygiene Crying poses a serious threat to the world economyPakistan’s economic wrestling is still hesitant in the middle of the whirlpool under normal circumstances So far the world has very few solutions to fight the coronavirus One of the most effective solutions is to minimize social interactions In Pakistan too efforts are being made to prepare people for this But the question bothering everyone at the moment is whether Pakistan’s economic situation is capable of bearing the burden of any kind of partial or complete lockdownUnder no circumstances can the answer be yes Even under normal circumstances Pakistan has failed to fight inflation and poverty biggest challenge is the economic situation of the average Pakistani which does not allow him to be limited to the extent that saves him from the virusThere is urgent need to invest in research infrastructure for reliable data on population health nutrition agricultural practices climate change ecosystems sustainability and human behaviour government must increase funding for agricultural and nutrition research Although institutes on nutrition and hunger already exist increased international cooperation is needed to close the knowledge gap It also includes social science issues such as how to change the behavior of consumers and farmers and how to introduce previously neglected agricultural cropsThe implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs also requires coordinated consideration of research findings coronavirus has given us opportunity to think about how to balance nutrition and environmental goals in Pakistan from analysis to how to motivate consumers to eat healthy and sustainable food
Mahnoor Sheikh,War is not the only threat to countries,2020-05-12,Politics,Time to reassess prioritiesFor centuries countries have preferred increasing military power thinking this is what adds to their security and sovereignty year 2020 however is eyeopener for many such power seeking states who prioritised defence over human developmentThe turn of the decade has so far shown both these aspects of state’s behaviour In January the world faced a threat of a war when the United States and Iran locked horns over the killing of Iranian Commander General Qassem Soleimani in a US airstrike in Baghdad threat of war was alleviated after both sides realised that allout war would only lead to further destruction and neither side especially Iran could afford it Just as the world took a sigh of relief from the global threat of war there emerged a new threat from China in the form of coronavirus It did not take long for the novel virus also called Covid19 to become a global pandemic bringing life to a halt across the world and crippling already feeble economiesThis was unprecedented in human history We had heard of lockdowns in specific regions or countries but the entire world had never stopped functioning at once As of yesterday the virus has infected more than 42 million people worldwide claiming over 284000 lives and forcing the rest of the world to stay at home Doctors and nurses not soldiers are on the front lines to fight this invisible enemy Ventilators and protective gears not military equipment are needed to save human lives Welfare programmes not defence deals are keeping the poor from dying of hungerThe war mongering has been forgotten against the collective good of protecting the humanity from a pandemic Science and technology are the only saviours and all eyes are on scientists as the world awaits a coronavirus vaccine or a miracle that could end the pandemicWith this pandemic causing widespread implications for the world it is high time states redefine their priorities Developing countries like ours have to face even worse consequences for they were already struggling with their economies which can collapse if a vaccine is not discovered soon security dilemma has always pushed states towards higher military spending at the cost of development projects This is evident from data released by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute SIPRI last year that the world military expenditure rose to 18 trillion in 2018 with defence spending in the US alone increasing by 66 per cent It has been on the rise since US President Donald Trump has been in office His denial and blame game with China has made the US one of the worst hit countries by coronavirus with the death toll now around 81000 This forced him to give the mighty 22 trillion economic rescue package aiding businesses workers and healthcare systemsContrary to this global health spending stood at just 995 billion in 2019 according to World Health Organisation WHO which is in stark contrast with the gigantic military spending realpolitik has always cost human development but even the countries that claimed better healthcare facilities could not survive the coronavirus outbreakIt has changed how security was viewed in 21st century dimension of human security has received a new meaning world is now convinced that human health and safety comes above everything With travel restrictions and partial to complete lockdowns in many countries the world has come to realise that defence power is of no use if human lives are in danger war mongering has been forgotten against the collective good of protecting the humanity from a pandemic Science and technology are the only saviours and all eyes are on scientists as the world awaits a coronavirus vaccine or a miracle that could end the pandemic We could have been a little optimistic had there been more investment in scientific innovations that would have contributed to the global race to find a vaccine but the current helplessness on the part of the world is disheartening to say the leastWe are not sure how long it will take for the world to recover from this shock but once life gets back to normal states would have to reconsider their previous protectionist policies and enhance their cooperation through increased trade to overcome the losses incurred to the economies In crises like these the importance of international organisations international financial institutions and INGOs has also been gauged as they have stepped forward in helping the world overcome the crisis and preventing economic collapseThis can be seen as the revival of liberal order for there is and will be increased demand of cooperation communication and integrated technologies during and after Covid19 pandemic This means the nationalist and populist sentiments that had been on the rise would have to be put aside with states investing more in human security environment protection and developmentThese are testing times and a part of the challenge emerges due to securitycentric nature of states having long prioritised hard power over development Among the many lessons this pandemic has taught us is that war is not the only threat to countries If only states understand this in future and be better prepared to protect their people from unconventional threats
Humayun Gauhar,Historic blunders,2020-07-12,Politics,To rule successfully is to rule well To rule well is to give the people what they want It would be good for Prime Minister Imran Khan to make his own list of what he thinks it is that the people want I would say that first and foremost people want to live They don’t want to live like stray dogs on the street They want to live in dignity with at least their basic needs met They want security and reassurance against threats being perpetually meted out by demented neighbours It goes without saying that they want life liberty and to use a good phrase from the American constitution– “the pursuit of happiness” That is their bounden right And it shouldn’t be difficult to understand Prime Minister Imran Khan I feel has got caught up in the difficulties of implementing his agenda which raised people’s hopes sky high and which level of expectation he is finding it hard to reach Needless to say people also want food shelter and clothing the old slogan of the People’s Party which it didn’t take seriously They want health facilities they want education for their children because in Islam it is the basic fundamental right of every person to be able to develop his or her mind to its fullest potential and it is the duty of the State if it really is Islamic state to provide the wherewithal for that I will at some point make a list of what are the fundamental Islamic rights of people in Islamic State which it is Imran Khan’s duty to implement not immediately but at least give it a startMost importantly the people want justice at every level which is most strikingly absent in today’s Pakistan There are tens of thousands of people languishing in prison just awaiting trial and our judiciary is overwhelmed by the numbers and unnecessary bureaucratic procedures and many laws that are asses Many have spent more time in prison awaiting trial then they would if they had been convicted for the crime they have allegedly committed Take the case of Mir Shakil ur Rehman owner of the Jang Group He is languishing in incarceration for over four months now without any formal charges being brought against him What prize justice This in itself is abhorrence to the concept of natural law That is not all Many journalists and press mediums are under unnecessary pressures Channel 24 was closed down for a time and given quite a run around till a court restored its viewership Imran Khan should realize that he who takes on the media never wins media is a ball of fire that you can’t hold Look at what happened to Richard Nixon Look at what happened to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who arrested many editors Chaudhry Shujat Husain gave Imran Khan sterling advice when he told him not to open yet another front with the media unless he has his case watertight and one that is likely to be accepted in honourable court of law media has become the fourth pillar of the state and taking it on is like taking on Parliament or the judiciary or even elements in the executive especially the Army which Imran should have learnt by now ends up calling the shots when it wants toPeople also moan about Imran Khan’s team and how wanting it seems to be A few notable exceptions notwithstanding the people are not wrong Why has intelligent man like Imran Khan made such a stunningly mediocre team To understand that one has to understand that he is a child of the system and the system is atrocious in the extreme When a prime minister is forced to choose his team from the small pool of the National Assembly and Senate instead of from amongst all the very able Pakistanis available it is not surprising that his team is mediocre system is a child of the constitution and the constitution is a child of the annihilation of democratic principles made as it is by a rump assembly after the loss of East Pakistan and the majority party that had been elected constitution is a product of our historic misfortunes and mistakes starting from before the Partition of India Being still mentally colonized by the British it is a no brainer that like other colonies we adopted the British political system which may work for them although it has stopped working now but which can never work for a federation like Pakistan India did the same and where are its people now As wretched as everIt has become conventional wisdom that Imran Khan cannot be replaced because there is no alternative to him anymore True Within this system there really isn’t which to me more than anything else symbolizes the utter and complete collapse of our system In fact electoral democracy be it parliamentary or presidential is actually failing all over the world and the method of government making will need to change drastically Pakistan is not the only country which looks like it has no choices Does the USA President Trump was actually no choice Democratic Party is unable to come up with a credible presidential nominee and have fallen back on old and stale man In Britain Boris Johnson does not leave much to be desired There also is no potential prime minister who seems to be knocking on the door of Ten Downing Street They will also have to rethink their systemThe most glaring dilution of the will of the people comes from having Electoral Colleges to choose a head of government In the USA you have electoral college of a few hundred people who elect the president and they often go against the popular vote as they did the last time In Britain you have the House of Commons comprising some 600odd members who act as the electoral college We have to presume here that the electors in electoral colleges truly represent the will of the people which they patently do notBack to Pakistan Our first problem was in the Partition formula that areas with Muslim majorities could go to Pakistan and the princely states would depend on the decision of their ruler point is that where Muslims were in a majority in India they did not feel insecure and thus their demand for Pakistan was weaker than in areas where they were in a minority and felt insecure and threatened But because we followed the formula of where Muslims were in a majority we forgot the Muslims who lived in a minority and hankered after Pakistan much more I think this formula was first suggested by Allama Iqbal in his famous Allahabad address But if you ask me I cannot think of alternate formulaPakistan ended up with a Constituent Assembly that had been elected in another country one year before Partition that other country being United India Thus many of the MPs in our new Constituent Assembly did not even have constituencies in Pakistan What should have happened is that the founding fathers no matter what the difficulties should have called immediate elections in the new country so that those elected to Parliament could be called true representatives In the event we did not do this and ended up taking nine years to make Pakistan’s first constitution in 1956 That was another mistake Pakistan was divided into two wings separated by 1000 miles of hostile Indian territory politicians of West Pakistan were keen that power should not go to the Bengalis of East Pakistan and that the country should be ruled by West Pakistan primarily the martial Punjabis and the swarthy Pathans with Sindhis thrown in Balochistan was not on the scene In order to prevent the Bengalis of East Pakistan forming a government we devised a satanic formula which was called the Parity Principle which assumed that the population of the two wings east and west would be deemed to be the same thus emasculating the six percent majority of East Pakistan Democracy was entirely absent and the cornerstone of democracy the will of the people entirely undermined To make it look good the 1956 Constitution forced West Pakistan’s four provinces to amalgamate into what they called the ‘One Unit’ Thus the smaller provinces like Balochistan and others in the Northern Areas were in a way deprived even of their identity Mind you all this came at the hands of the politicians of West Pakistan surprising thing is that the Bengali politicians of East Pakistan agreed to it apologists insist that the East Pakistanis did so for the sake of unity which is the most stupid argument borne of hindsight That was another mistake People ask why East Pakistan accepted the Parity Principle usual answer is that they wanted a constitution and ‘democracy at any price’ If true it actually shows utter misunderstanding of democracy Not to forget that the 1956 Constituent Assembly was by now very different from the original Constituent Assembly of 1947 This constitution was unworkable and antidemocratic and led to the military coup of 1958 which required the President of Pakistan a civilian to declare martial law and ask the Army to take over Needless to say the Army kicked him out of the country in 21 days and then we had our first military ruler for ten years That was General Ayub Khan who later made himself into a Field Marshal Truth to tell he ruled successfully because he more than any of his predecessors and successors developed the economy and gave the people a lot of what they wanted But that should not be indictment against the people’s vote This was not really the first coup first was when the civil bureaucracy took over the office of Governor General and a little later another finance services officer was appointed prime ministerThis is a long subject on which I will have to write more in the coming weeks We will pick up the thread next time
Humayun Gauhar,Slavery Everywhere,2020-07-06,Politics,Slavery became peonageSlavery was ended in the United States in 1866 one year after the Thirteenth Amendment But the states of Alabama Texas Louisiana Arkansas Georgia Missouri Florida Tennessee and South Carolina found a way around it It was called ‘peonage’ from which the British introduced the word ‘peon’ as office boy in the subcontinent and the word is still used in some places in India and Pakistan Peonage meant that arrested Blacks could be leased out to work for White men who could then use them for all kinds of work as they did the slaves To enable this they established ‘laws’ known as Black Codes For example in Louisiana it was illegal for a Black man to preach to a Black congregation without obtaining permission from the police If they were caught they could be arrested and fined And if they could not pay the fine which needless to say was stupendously high the Black man was forced to work for individual or go to jail where he would work until his debt was paid offAn unemployed Black person he or she could be arrested and imprisoned for vagrancy and loitering It was worse in South Carolina where if the parent of a Black child was considered a vagrant the judicial system allowed the police or some other government agency to “apprentice” the child to “employer” Black men could be held until they were 21 and females until they were 18 Their socalled owner had the right to inflict punishment on the child even for disobedience and to recapture them if he or she ran away Peonage is systemic racism It was established and perpetrated by government systems Such acts of racism were inbuilt into the systems hence systemic racism So peonage meant the reenslavement of Blacks through the prison system and at one time more than 800000 Blacks were part of the peonage system It ended around 1940 What enabled it was the wording of the Thirteenth Amendment which said that “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the United States…” What hypocrisy Thus the smallest of transgressions was made into a crime Once again this is peonage Because every white Southern farmer hated the ending of slavery Black courts were introduced as a way to appease themJahalat abounds in this Islamic Republic of Pakistan from the highest levels of government down to the ‘peon’ as it were You see it all the time and can only lament In their ignorance they also violate some of the fundamental human rights which are universalI submit that slavery and peonage are still embedded in Man’s DNA We have been going on about US slavery for the last two or three articles but lest we start gloating we should remember that everyone is a victim of it in one way or another Slavery was actually started by the Arabs and is also referred to in the Holy Quran but not called ‘abomination’ first slaves in Africa were captured by Arabs and because the British were then the global overlords they took them and sold them to White Americans Arabs even brought slavery to the Indian subcontinent first slaves were brought and sold by Arab raider Mohammad bin Qasim to Sind then in British India He converted many people to Islam whom he called ‘Momins’ which means ‘true believer’ This is from where the word ‘Memon’ comes from graves of his soldiers can still be found in a place called Makli near KarachiIn human crimes against people continuing to this day a few days ago a woman in Pakistan was stoned to death by her husband and his brother because she was somehow violating the law of ‘vani’ which is a family against whom something is proved to a village court and the punishment is to hand over one or more girls regardless of how old they are to the socalled victim Another local law is the exchange of women as wives which is called ‘karo kari’ In Islam no one especially a girl can be forced into marriage by anyone except by choice And the most horrible practice of all is so called ‘honour killing’ which should more aptly be called ‘dishonour killing’ in which even the mother and father of the victim participate What kind of mindset is thatSadly such practices exist everywhere In Indian villages ‘satti’ or wife burning on the husband’s funeral pyre still occurs Such things are preStone Age What can one say I suspect that even cannibalism exists in certain parts of God’s worldActually one of the main purposes of life is to gather knowledge and shun ignorance Ignorance is a sin of one of the worst kinds One of the fundamental human rights in Islam is that every person should be able to develop his or her mind to the fullest and it is the duty of the State to provide the wherewithal for that and yet in this Islamic republic of ours we have customs and even laws which would make even people from the Age of Ignorance which is called ‘jahiliya’ blush preIslamic era is called jahiliya and from there stems the word jahalat which means ‘ignorance’ though I am assured by people who claim to know better that even the jahiliya was age of the flourishing of arts and cultureThe point is that jahalat abounds in this Islamic Republic of Pakistan from the highest levels of government down to the ‘peon’ as it were You see it all the time and can only lament In their ignorance they also violate some of the fundamental human rights which are universalThomas Jefferson was a great political mind But he was also a slave owner So today the debate rages in the USA whether his memorabilia should be removed We should all remember that human beings are products of their time and what is considered terrible today by society was considered acceptable then
Humayun Gauhar,The face of prejudice,2020-06-28,Politics,One of the most acute manifestations of prejudice is racism It reveals the mindset of a person and a large part of the society he or she comes from They may be very intelligent and witty but their racism is manifest and they have perpetrated untold miseries on people of a race that they thought was inferior That shows the basest view of people who think that theirs is a superior race They don’t stop to think that biologically all humans are the same with similar blood groups DNA and what have you It is just their outside look that sets them apart- their features and the colour of their skin Truth to tell white is not pigmentation but the acute lack of it So coloured people can consider people with lack of pigmentation as inferior That’s as far as I’ll go otherwise I’m in danger of sounding racist Suffice it to say that people are people and that’s the end of itBut racism causes Man to inflict untold inhumanity on people with a different look One such racist was the ohsointelligent and witty Winston Churchill once Prime Minister of Britain Here are some of his choicest comments about other people –“I do not agree that the dog in a manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have lain there for a very long time I do not admit that right I do not admit for instance that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race a highergrade race a more worldly wise race to put it that way has come in and taken their place” “dog” here are the Palestinians whom Churchill called a “lower manifestation” and advocated the creation of the Israeli StateChurchill was a product of genocidal British Imperialism at its worst and they have gone and built monuments to him This man of limited emotion starved four million to death in India in 1943 and has been voted the Greatest Briton of All Time That’s a grave insult to the British He boasted that “all who resist” meaning the Pashtoons “will be killed without quarter” and that the people of Afghanistan must “recognise the superiority of race” This about a people who take great pride in their race He wrote with great relish about the Pashtoon tribesmen who were routinely and summarily executed Let’s go on He advocated “self rule” of Afrikaners in South Africa and thus helped plant the seeds of apartheid About Egypt he said in 1959 “tell them that if we have any more of their cheek we will set the Jews on them and drive them into the gutter from which they should never have emerged”In 1896 he declared on Cuba “a grave danger represents itself Two fifths of the insurgents in the field are negroes These men…would in the event of success demand a predominant share in the government…the result being after years of fighting another Black republic”Another racist feather in Churchill’s cap is that he ordered more that 150000 Kenyans to be put into concentration camps as part of the land grab of fertile highlands in Kenya for white colonial settlers Churchill called them “Blackamoors” who were raped castrated tortured and burnt He introduced forced labour which is slavery by another name He committed genocide against the Irish killing hundreds kidnapping them beating them and burning down their propertiesThen Churchill ordered the British army to massacre Greek antiFascists in Athens in December 1944 In fact he praised Nazi collaborators in Greece so that he could paint Communists as part of the enemy About the Afghan campaign in 1897 he said “We proceeded systematically village by village and destroyed the houses filled up the wells blew down the towers cut down the great shady trees burned the crops and broke the reservoirs in punitive devastation”So here we have the Greatest Briton of them All To compound their shame and embarrassment the British have erected many statues of him all over the land including one in their Parliament building Churchill was a highly prejudiced racist with a great sense of superiority which is the camouflage for a sense of inferiority They stole from their colonies especially from India with great abandon and thus built a powerful mercantile industrial complex I don’t see what the difficulty is in removing his statues except for the fact that rewritten history about Churchill has so infected the British mindThis kind of racism did not end with Churchill Today US President Donald Trump proudly parades it for all to see He probably hates George Floyd for having the impudence to die under the knee of a white policeman Or all the Blacks who were killed by White policemen as if the hunting season was at its peak In fact I have before me a 1922 State of Missouri “nigger hunting license” that whoever pays the license fee “is hereby licensed to hunt and kill niggers during the open season hereof in Missouri This license must be carried on person when hunting niggers and gives the holder permission to hunt day or night with or without dogs”This kind of licensing may have lapsed in law but it is still prevalent in the white man’s DNA considering the callous manner in which white policemen wantonly kill African Americans reaction has finally come and it is severe and will change America hopefully for the better This is what the manifestation of prejudice is all about Not that it is unique to America it has existed in virtually every part of the world in history but that does not justify it Man and his society have not progressed a jot and are still victims at least of latent prejudice I rest my case
Humayun Gauhar,The Gun Slinger,2020-06-22,Politics,Man has been pretty awful to other menWhen I say gunslinger your mind would automatically go to the USA It certainly comes across as the Number One gunslinger who is extremely trigger happy But it is not alone There are others many others and in history virtually every country of consequence has been a gunslinger It is only that right now we the rest of the world are being faced with the American gunslinger which is led by irresponsible and intellectually wanting manAmerica’s current gunslinging is most of all open season on Black Americans Somehow it has got ingrained in the White man’s DNA over the years I can’t forget that not even a century ago the State of Missouri used to issue hunting licenses to people to kill what we then happily called “Negroes” or “niggers” That hunting license has got ingrained in their DNA and in the white man especially in the police it is still there It has become instinctive so that if something untoward happens anywhere it is automatically assumed that a black man is behind it Which makes me think that had George Floyd been white he may not have been killed wantonly by a white police officer or the black man in Georgia who was shot dead by white police for being drunk These were just the last two killings recently that we know of they are part of a long list of killings where you would have thought they were shooting some wild animal and the President of the United States is in denial trying to minimize it fact is that the country has erupted in protests which is why I and many many others are talking of a seminal change from the grievous weakening of the dollar to the fragmentation of the United StatesWhile talking of Man’s cruelties it is easy to forget Man’s achievements America’s achievements in science technology and medicine have been amazing and may they never stop In our feeling of hurt right now it is easy to forget that the white man is also a human being and deserves as much consideration as a nonwhite So let’s not start gloating over their temporary misfortune After all the Covid19 crisis has made everyone look to the USA to find the vaccine Frankly instead of going on lambasting generation after generation and state after state the world should be looking for consensus and equilibrium to live in harmony and never forget that we have one world to share And if we destroy the entire cake there will not be one slice left for anyoneThe litany of crimes against mankind done by the European colonizers does not even bear thinking about what the British did in India and Africa what the French did in their colonies and the Dutch in Indonesia and the Belgians in Africa And of course what the white man did to the original or Native Americans it was a horrendous number far overtaking the number killed in Hitler’s Holocaust If the African is unwilling settler in America the white man is a willing settler who killed the natives and stole their land In India to quote just one incident the muslin weavers in Bengal lived in a cluster of around seven villages Their product was providing grave competition to the cotton of the Manchester textile mills so the Brits cut off their thumbs In the 1980s their graves were found in Bengal where all the men were thumbless British did this through the world’s first ever corporation called the East India Company When the first rebellion against the Company was quashed the Indian Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried for ‘treason’ found guilty and banished along with his family to Burma He was a great poet and his grave was found I think in the 1980s in Burma Have you ever heard of such nonsense That the ruler of a country is tried for treason against a firm It beggars imagination British colonizers in Australia used to play polo with the heads of Aboriginal children After hearing this my daughter started cursing but if I told her the entire litany of Man’s cruelty against Man her hair would turn white at this young age As Wordsworth said “And much it grieved my heart to think what Man has made of Man”What Man has done to Man does not bear thinking about killings of Chinese during the Great October Revolution of 1949 thoughtless killings in Russia during and after the socalled revolution how African states still fall on one another in tribal conflicts and I daresay indulge in cannibalism the Crusaders who killed children in villages they took over and barbequed them for their consumption how the stomachs of pregnant women were ripped open during the PakistanBangladesh civil war and little flags planted in their wombs how British perfidy led to unknown amount of killing and dislocation in India and Pakistan what the Spanish did in South America…want me to go onThe While Man has been a very constructive species he has also been a very destructive one Ingrained racism is widespread Else why would a cream called “Fair and Lovely” be so popular in Pakistan and I daresay India A mullah in Pakistan says that in Heaven the black women who become houris will turn white I didn’t bother you with how the Neanderthals were made extinct by homo sapiens– two species that used to conjugate and reproduce They say there is 4fourt to five percent of Neanderthal blood in all of usMy point is that in Man’s cruelty against Man America alone does not stand out rest of us are also vile culprits So when and if homo sapiens ‘the wise hominoid’ finally makes himself extinct we have no idea what may come Anyway in all this turmoil the US Presidential elections are upon us President Trump’s rival Joe Biden fears that a defeated Trump will refuse to part from office and the US military will be forced to escort him out of the White House Why say escort Let’s say frog march But one mad man does not entire country makeWhile talking of Man’s cruelties it is easy to forget Man’s achievements America’s achievements in science technology and medicine have been amazing and may they never stop In our feeling of hurt right now it is easy to forget that the white man is also a human being and deserves as much consideration as a nonwhite So let’s not start gloating over their temporary misfortune After all the Covid19 crisis has made everyone look to the USA to find the vaccine Frankly instead of going on lambasting generation after generation and state after state the world should be looking for consensus and equilibrium to live in harmony and never forget that we have one world to share And if we destroy the entire cake there will not be one slice left for anyone
Humayun Gauhar,Life or Livelihood,2020-06-15,Politics,world’s reserve currency political systems behaviour are all changingThis is a terrible choice Especially for a government It is a choice before every government in the world and the answer is not easy Because of that most governments will opt for the middle courseThe problem is that if governments continue with the lockdown their economies will suffer further and employment businesses and therefore livelihoods become near impossible If they end the lockdown then the pandemic will spread and many more people will die and that’s the end of life It’s a double whammy But then without livelihood life will decrease if not end With life continuing as it did in the precovid19 era life will end at the hands of the pandemic perhaps faster So what is the point Remember the purpose of every government is to improve the human condition and if the human condition declines I ask again what is the point Until a vaccine is found and the virus stopped dead in its tracks there will be no answer So the middle course will be what everyone is trying to do Ease the lockdown and get as many people back to their jobs while implementing strict SOPs problem is to ensure that the SOPs are followedWhen the lockdown was eased in Pakistan just look at the crowds that gathered in bazaars without regard to social distancing and many not wearing masks Obviously the pandemic will spread hospitals will be even more overwhelmed and governments will be at their wits end obvious answer is to manage not control human behaviour That’s easier said than done You have to be a strict oneparty state like China to be able to do that In a flawed democracy or the pretence of it you cannot One would say you need to educate the populace so that they understand the difference between right and wrong and what’s good for them and bad for them That’s also easier said than done So the pandemic will spread economies will derail until people learn hard lessons Social distancing and masks and handwashing and all that jazz will become the cultural norm It was our government like others that was caught between a rock and a hard place– life or livelihood There is a triple whammy too a burgeoning debt huge fiscal and current account deficits as too a trade deficit People not paying income tax a scourge our governments have perennially brought upon themselves by not applying income tax on many sectors of the economy like agriculture That’s about 23 percent of the GDP that goes scotfree Add to that incomplete documentation of the economy and you already have impossible situation on your hands But let’s not labour the point because in our kind of electoral democracy if you lose the sympathy of the landlord you lose his vote in the lower house of Parliament and will not be able to form a government Obviously this cries out for a change in the system That’s not all There is also the humongous annual debt servicing bill and the perpetual bleeding done on the government’s resources by white elephants called the ‘public sector enterprises’ These have to be rationalized very fast either by closure or by privatization or by selling 26 percent shares to strategic managers Given these difficulties the government did a creditable job introducing a Budget at all There is little room for criticismThat’s not the only thing that is failing great political systems of the world which are best described as electoral democracies are about to bite the dust for they have stopped delivering and we as God says have to “choose from amongst the best”Pakistan does not exist in a vacuum No country does It should be obvious that the USA is the engine of the global economy and if it suffers its economy suffers and so does the global economy And so too does Pakistan and every other country centerpiece of the US economy is its currency that they made the global reserve currency instead of gold So every country is hostage to the dollar and if the dollar goes down other countries will go down because they will be holding reserves in paper whose value has diminished I have been saying this in my last few articles but I am not alone Many American writers are warning of the fall of the dollar For example Stephen Roach writes in Bloomberg ‘A crash in the dollar is coming’ It would be useful to quote at some length from his article“The era of the US dollar’s “exorbitant privilege” as the world’s primary reserve currency is coming to end Then French Finance Minister Valery Giscard d’Estaing coined that phrase in the 1960s largely out of frustration bemoaning a US that drew freely on the rest of the world to support its overextended standard of living For almost 60 years the world complained but did nothing about it Those days are overAlready stressed by the impact of the Covid19 pandemic US living standards are about to be squeezed as never before At the same time the world is having serious doubts about the once widely accepted presumption of American exceptionalism Currencies set the equilibrium between these two forces domestic economic fundamentals and foreign perceptions of a nation’s strength or weakness balance is shifting and a crash in the dollar could well be in the offingThe seeds of this problem were sown by a profound shortfall in domestic US savings that was glaringly apparent before the pandemic In the first quarter of 2020 net national saving which includes depreciationadjusted saving of households businesses and the government sector fell to 14 of national income This was the lowest reading since late 2011 and onefifth the average of 7 from 1960 to 2005Lacking in domestic saving and wanting to invest and grow the US has taken great advantage of the dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve currency and drawn heavily on surplus savings from abroad to square the circle But not without a price In order to attract foreign capital the US has run a deficit in its current account which is the broadest measure of trade because it includes investment every year since 1982Covid19 and the economic crisis it has triggered is stretching this tension between saving and the currentaccount to the breaking point culprit exploding government budget deficits According to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office the federal budget deficit is likely to soar to a peacetime record of 179 of gross domestic product in 2020 before hopefully receding to 98 in 2021”So there you have it in plain words It is not just me saying this But something cannot disappear without something else appearing in its place Nature abhors a vacuum And as I have said before that something else has to be the Chinese Yuan I have been accused of having a “gilded view” of China but something that is so obvious would be foolhardy to ignoreThis will be the last great test for independent Pakistan before we settle down to the new currency regimeThat’s not the only thing that is failing great political systems of the world which are best described as electoral democracies are about to bite the dust for they have stopped delivering and we as God says have to “choose from amongst the best”I said that human behaviour has to be managed When you’re managing something it has to be of a manageable size This cries out for smaller states that will be easier to manage but that’s a long subject and we will get into it at some later date when I have the time and you have the patience
Humayun Gauhar,Knee on the World’s Neck,2020-06-07,Politics,A new thesis creating a new synthesisChange is constant Once it takes place it can never be reversed Philosophers used to wonder how change takes place and why Unable to find the answer they assumed a static world which was absurd It was not until Hegel appeared on the scene that a reason for change emergedHegel said that change is inherent At the same time there is a thesis and antithesis two interact synthesise and transcend the situation with a new thesis emerging immediately and simultaneously antithesis And the process goes on It is the process that causes conflict which is how things change Hegel called this process the dialectic Of course Hegel was talking in terms of not the secular but the metaphysical We can take a liberty and call it the cosmic dialecticAppeared Karl Marx who was talking more in terms of the secular and the worldly He too wondered how and why things change and society changes He picked up Hegel’s dialectic and said that conflict was inherent There was a thesis and antithesis which clashed not synthesized and a new situation appeared And so on It led to change conflict that Marx was talking about was basically class conflict which means the worker and the mill owner the peasant and the landlord Society would then change from the feudal to the industrial there would be a workers revolution and everything would end up belonging to the State After this would arrive utopiaWell it did not happen like this because Marx did not see the emergence of trade unions and joint stock companies Nor did he know that Vladimir Ilyich Lenin would hijack his ideas and lead a minority in Russia called the Bolsheviks to overthrow the majority called the Mensheviks It was a coup which he called a revolution There was wholesale nationalization collectivization of land to increase agricultural output and build lumbering new factories to make armaments because the Second World War and Hitler had descended upon the country This was all the brainchild of Stalin along with the people who were his fellow travellers In so doing Stalin destroyed the revolution to save the revolutionRacism and prejudice has been instilled in American children with games like ‘Cowboys and Indians’ a book called ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ Even today Clint Eastwood films like Dirty Harry lionize the rampant policeman They only have themselves to blame America created many instruments to colonise and subjugate the world the most obvious of which are the World Bank the IMF and their institutions and trapped Third World Countries in chains of debt time has come for these chains to be broken agenda of the freedom of the blacks is still incomplete God willing it will complete soonIt could not last because according to the Marxist process Russia did not enter into the industrial stage but went straight from feudalism to socialism Capitalism was overthrown but sadly replaced by State capitalism Rights of workers and ordinary citizens were trampled as increasingly the Communist Party became a hardened bureaucracy They tried to spread their revolution to other countries already having created empire out of Central Asian states and stupidly annexed Afghanistan which nobody has been able to conquer and subjugate from the Iranians to the British to the Russians All were vanquished and left diminished It was like the last straw and the Soviet Union soon collapsedThe latest attempt at Afghan annexation was by the United States of America After 20 years of death and destruction America is finally leaving in defeat and disgrace with its tail between its legs and once again Pakistan will be left to pick up the piecesThe Soviet Union started cracking up after its Afghan defeat United States now looks to be cracking up after its Afghan defeat Cracking up could take many forms- a rearrangement of the State a rearrangement of policy a rearrangement of even ideology the downfall of capitalism in its most naked form as practiced in America Time will tell But one thing is obvious- the defeat in Afghanistan put paid to the USSR defeat in Afghanistan could contribute to America’s break upMany commentators are unbelievably writing articles with frightening titles One is American Breakup secession is much closer than we think and its subheading is States with the most active secession movements are progressive and want to escape from a federal government they think too conservative It is written by FH Buckley of George Mason University in Spectator and his book ‘The Looming threat of a National Breakup’ is available He says in the article that “The United States is ripe for secession Across the world established states have divided in two or are staring down secession movements Great Britain became a wee bit less great with Irish independence and now the Scots seem to be rethinking the Act of Union 1707 Czechoslovakia is no more and the former Soviet Union is just that former Go down the list and there are secession groups in nearly every country And are we to think that almost alone in the world we’re immune from this” He says that America is “less united today than we’ve been at any time since the Civil War divided by politics religion and culture”Slavery was perhaps the strongest aspect of American culture weaker in the North slaves may finally have been freed but only in the legal sense They struggled for their civil rights and got them on paper Their leader Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated in his prime But these are only on paper In reality African is still looked at askance with a high degree of suspicion and is killed at the slightest suspicion even if he is totally innocent African is not American but subAmerican This is racist prejudice and American is not alone in harbouring it and not just against Africans Most countries have a disgustingly high level of racism Not to veer too far afield we Pakistanis looked upon the Bengalis of East Pakistan in much the same way and paid heavily for it Secession is nothing new We have all seen it many times Pakistan seceded from united India to make independent country East Pakistan seceded from Pakistan to make it Bangladesh breakup of the Soviet Union led to the emergence of some 15 new states South Sudan just happened and the Muslims of Sudan were separated from the Christians And the United Kingdom is facing break up with the Scots the Northern Irish and the Welsh harking for secession In fact the United Kingdom itself seceded from the European Union which they call Brexit And so the process goes on and America is not immune from it latest upheaval was triggered by the wanton killing of one black American called George Floyd at the hands of a white policeman country erupted in protests some violent that are still ongoing most powerful man in the world hid cowering in his bunker in fright along with his family Shades of Hitler in his bunker George Floyd has become a metaphor that could prove to be the last straw that could lead to the eventual breakup of America into many different independent states which are self sufficient I gave the example of California in my last article process may not be very fast but this last great superpower could follow the pattern of the Soviet Union George Floyd was killed by the white policeman’s knee pressing onto his neck and was asphyxiated America calls itself ‘the Policeman of the World’ This ‘policeman’ has had its knee on the neck of the world since World War II They have annihilated Afghanistan they have decimated Iraq and Syria to mention just three Does it need saying that they all happened to be Muslim countries earliest decimation that happened at White America’s hands was that of the Native Americans whom they called ‘Red Indians’ Racism and prejudice has been instilled in American children with games like ‘Cowboys and Indians’ a book called ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ Even today Clint Eastwood films like Dirty Harry lionize the rampant policeman They only have themselves to blame America created many instruments to colonise and subjugate the world the most obvious of which are the World Bank the IMF and their institutions and trapped Third World Countries in chains of debt time has come for these chains to be broken agenda of the freedom of the blacks is still incomplete God willing it will complete soon
Humayun Gauhar,Knowledge intellect & wisdom,2020-05-31,Politics,Living in interesting timesI have always said it but it bears repetition change is always happening in the world but rapid change takes place but rarely Today we have rapid change and we are lucky to be alive to see it Change of this magnitude redraws national boundaries and changes attitudes and societyAmerica is on fire trigger was the killing of a black man called George Floyd by a policeman He was choked to death It was one death too many Anger frustration and rage spilled over Right now more than 30 cities are on fire and have become a battleground open season on blacks in America may have come to endAt the other end of the world China is finding its economy contracting for the first time in the last 40 years or so It is at odds with India and has occupied part of the territory it claims That territory is extremely pivotal for three countries- China India and Pakistan- because from there India can launch attack on Pakistan’s GilgitBaltistan and thence cut off the ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor under construction CPEC as it is called is vital for China and the development of Pakistan and therefore just as much of a thorn in India’s side Two of India’s spy drones that intruded into Pakistan have already been shot down News is that the Chinese army has given another thrashing to the Indian army It seems that the fragmentation of British India which started in 1947 is proceeding apace It is obvious that India is spoiling for war which the world can ill afford An IndiaPakistanChina war is in danger of becoming nuclear world economy is contracting and we are facing a global depression for the first time since the Great Depression It has already started world map would change after a world war as it did after the two previous world wars To craft another global status quo requires a great deal of knowledge intellect and dare I say it wisdom which is in short supplyWhat has happened is not gone and what is going to happen has already happened We just can’t see it just as we can only now see the supernova of a star four billion light years away That is in our future but it has already happened So humility my dear friends humility It is not in the nature of human beings to have humility unless they are spiritually very developed which few are But at least give it a trySo fragile is the global equilibrium that invisible virus has thrown it into a tailspin We can’t see it we don’t understand it and we can’t find a cure for it We can’t even get to the roots of it with China and the USA variously blaming one another When humanity is in such a state of confusion the tendency is always to look for answers in the spiritual realm apart from the scientific I remember years ago Dr Abdus Salam told me that they could never find the Grand Unified Theory otherwise known as the Theory of Everything unless the spiritual and the scientific were to join forces I think it will happen one day You see if you accept that the Creator determines everything even a virus it might enhance your understanding If you realize how infinitesimal we are that we can be killed by a lowly virus then we may see sense We have always seen the Earth open and more earth poured into it more earth is the dead body the soul having gone off to its Maker All we are left with is the mound of earth While we are alive we cannot even control our ego and keep exaggerating our ‘achievements’ and the ephemeral wealth we may have gathered We keep saying this is mine that is mine without realizing that it is not anyone’s Everything belongs to God and our reality is a mound of earth Don’t we say dust to dust and ashes to ashes To which I would add earth to earth and sod to sodDoesn’t God refer in the Quran to “that clinging thing” referring to a foetus that becomes human A human finally goes back to becoming “that clinging thing” again All our ambitions all our ego just disappear when we become that sod of earthNow with the USA on fire and commentators on television wondering whether the State exists or not do you still laugh at that Russian who said that America would fragment into five states Truth to tell there is not one USA but many the most obvious being White America and Black America Many of its states are economically selfsufficient like California In fact it is the fifth largest economy in the world and it is only a provinceThis is difficult to comprehend for small minds that depend on their information on newspapers Where is the Roman Empire Muslim Empire British Empire Now Britain itself is in fear of fragmenting This starts you thinking on what a natural nation state could be and the answer lies in the name for a nation tells you everything Britain is a collection of at least four nations each with its own culture cuisine language history apparel and what have you Perhaps one day even these attributes might disappear and we get different methodologies of governing ourselvesOne big change could be that perhaps in this global turmoil we might see the Muslims form alliance and create a real ummah of believers in one God But no so long as we have the effete greedy and cruel leaders who have occupied the world This global change anyway would be a very slow process and we will not see it during our lifetimes on Earth Hopefully we will see it from the life in the Hereafter but then who knows we may not be interested in such things and may find them too mundane when we are occupied trying to understand the glory of God’s creation Hopefully that is what it will beSo there is no point in taking fright from things we don’t understand and we never will We cannot stop going back to our primitive past in which we killed just to surviveThe onus of crafting the new status quo will not just be on humanity but also on natural forces If the quantum scientists are to be believed it has already been done for they have found that the past the present and the future all exist at the same time If we stop thinking in terms of linear time as we do on Earth then there is a chance we might understand this What has happened is not gone and what is going to happen has already happened We just can’t see it just as we can only now see the supernova of a star four billion light years away That is in our future but it has already happened So humility my dear friends humility It is not in the nature of human beings to have humility unless they are spiritually very developed which few are But at least give it a try
Humayun Gauhar,The wall has two sides,2020-05-17,Politics,China raises…I am talking of the Great Wall of China one of the wonders of the world What happens on either side is not static It keeps changing Before the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus the world order or the status quo was on the other side outside China and the USA was the undisputed hegemon or sole superpower Now after the coronavirus which first started on that side of the Wall things are changing and rather more rapidly than one had imagined Our job as no superpower but as a minion of the USA is still very difficult We have to watch and wait and be patient to see what kind of new status quo emerges and what our place should be in it Patience is one of the most important Chinese virtues and they think and plan generations in advance not expecting to see the end result for many years Former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai caught the essence of this thinking when asked what he thought of the French Revolution and replied “It’s too early to tell”Do not for a second imagine that a hegemon will lose its primacy easily USA is very powerful financially and militarily and it has got global institutions dancing to the tune of the dollar which leads to the world dancing to the tune of the dollar dollar will not go down without kicking and screaming and its kicks can be very hard and screams very loud But back to Pakistan We have to be careful that whilst not upsetting the USA to the point where it retaliates against us we should slowly and imperceptibly try and become a part of the new status quo the new world order with “Chinese characteristics” So caution and care should be the order of the day because we have to remember how much our external debt is and if they decide to squeeze our lemon so to speak very little juice will come out and Pakistan will just become a squeezed lemonBut we are also already very heavily beholden to China as well as heavily indebted to it Don’t forget that while the USA and its agencies have given us a great deal of loans China has only given us money for infrastructure Now with the ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor what China is giving us is loans mostly from private Chinese banks which will add to our debt stock But now there could be a way around it with China now pushing the Yuan to the detriment of the US dollar Lets’ see what happens As Zhou Enlai said “It is too early to tell”A lady friend of mine wrote from France after reading my last article that Pakistan has already sold its soul to China She said “While I agree that Pakistanis certainly have the knowhow and should have pride in ‘Made in Pakistan’ the country sold its soul to China decades ago China owns Pakistan– its ports dams roads etc And China has flooded Pakistan with cheap merchandise… Pakistan is not the only victim here many poorer countries have suffered the same fate and sacrificed their national dignity for ‘Made in China’ Africa is another example they exploit offer to build infrastructure etc and governments think so many foreigners will energize economies But the Chinese soon bring in their families who open shops undercut the local merchants by offering cheap ‘Made in China’ goods destroying the national fabric of society well thought out plan to world domination”I wrote back that I didn’t totally disagree with her but I don’t totally agree either West seems to have a phobia about China’s advance and spread We have had a large Chinese diaspora in Pakistan since 1949 Many were cobblers dentists and restaurateurs and later a few beauty salons “And shop owners…” she replied “And in Paris and NYC they own the manicurepedicure trade”There is nothing alarming about this It is natural to ply your trade That doesn’t mean that these countries have sold their soul to China It is just that we find it peculiar that there are so many Chinese shops and restaurants all over the place We have been to many Western cities and found South Asian restaurants everywhere and not very good ones by the way London and America’s hospitals are very dependent on Pakistani and Indian doctors and Filipina nurses but they haven’t sold their soul to these countriesMy worry is that the new hegemon will eventually expect us to change our behaviour according to their way of doing things just as the British did We have to prevent China from creating Pakistanis who are Chinese in every respect except for the colour of their skins In that for example the ChinaPakistan trade corridor will play a very important role In fact it is this beltroad initiative of China’s that is going to be one of the pivots of the new world order and Chinese hegemony But it does not need to be a bad or harmful element of the new world order If Pakistan’s goods and the goods of other countries can be exported east and west via Pakistan along the old Silk Road and thereafter even beyond what could the problem possibly be If Pakistanis switch to chicken corn soup instead of tea we would actually save a lot of money because our chicken and corn are indigenous while our tea is imported You see you have to think out of the boxCoincidentally as I had written last week there has been a fillip to the ‘Made in Pakistan’ concept where Pakistan is one of five countries that has been asked to make a vaccine out of remdesivir There is nothing innovative here because remdesivir has been around for a long time but at least it has been recognised that Pakistani pharmaceutical companies have the ability and wherewithal to make anti coronavirus vaccine by the millions If nothing else we could make more than enough money out of this which could defray our costs and losses fighting this virus This is just a start and you don’t know where it will lead point is always try and find the silver lining in the darkest of clouds
